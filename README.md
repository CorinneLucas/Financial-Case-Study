# Financial-Case-Study
Financial case study for the fictitious organization Southern Water Corporation. 
## Overview
- Southern Water Corp is a fictitious Israeli water desalination company that sells water to three different customer types: Residential, Public, and Private. 

- As the demand for freshwater is increasing, Southern Water Corp. needs to maximize the availability of its three desalination plants: Kootha, Surjek, and Jutik.

- This increase in demand leads to an increase in revenue, however, it also leads to an increase in production costs.

- This Financial Analysis is made to address both micro and macro analysis questions:

  * "What is the underlying story for the Revenues, Expenses, and EBIT at all plants combined?"

  * "Do the trends in Revenue, Expenses, and EBIT reveal differences between the three plants (Kootha, Surjik, and Jutik)?"

## Revenue
1. MICRO ANALYSIS - The first step in the Revenue Analysis consisted of determining the revenue of each desalination plant, broken down by customer type.
2. MACRO ANALYSIS - Using the revenues from the first step, the next step was to determine the overall revenue for each customer type for the entire company.
3. The last step of this analysis was to determine the contribution percent of each plant's customer segments.

FINDINGS:

- Of the ($437 M) in Revenue Sales over the July 2013 to June 2014 Period, Surjek provides close to 50% of Sales Volumes ($202 M), with Jutik ($164 M) and Kootha ($71 M) providing the remaining.

- Segmentation of the revenues by unit, reveals that of the three (3) customer segments, Private ($187 M) is the most popular, followed by Public ($147 M) and lastly Residential Sales ($102 M).

## Expenses
1. MICRO ANALYSIS - The first step in the Expenses Analysis looked at the expenses of each desalination plant broken down by cost type: Chemical Costs, Facility Costs, Operational Maintenance Costs, and Labor Costs.
2. MACRO ANALYSIS - The four cost types of each desalination plant were aggregated to get the total expenses by cost type for the entire business.
3. The last step of the Expense Analysis compared the Water Production amounts to the Chemical Expenditure cost (highest cost) to determine if there was a relationship between higher levels of Water Production and higher Chemical Expenditure costs.

FINDINGS:

- Targeted Expense Analysis reveals an interesting trend; Overall Costs sharply increased from December, with Chemical Expenses contributing $78.4 M (24.4%) towards the overall cost base.

- Further analysis singles-out Surjek with $179 M (55.8%) worth of expenses, contrasted to a much lower spend from Kootha ($51 M) and Jutik ($91 M), largely due to lower Chemical and Labour Expenditure.

- Drilling down to the cost-element level, reveals an indicative relationship between water production and chemical expenditure with this being particularly pronounced for the Surjek Unit which coincidentally has the highest rate of water production.

## EBIT
1. The final analysis of this project first consisted of finding the EBIT (Earnings Before Interest and Tax) of each desalination plant to determine which plant was most profitable.
2. Using the EBITs of the plants from step one, the last part of this analysis was to determine the EBIT Margins of each plant.

FINDINGS

- Concluding our analysis, Jutik has the highest overall EBIT contributions ($73 M), followed by Surjek ($23 M), and lastly Kootha ($20 M). However, from an EBIT  Margin (%) perspective, Kootha has a higher margin than Jutik, indicative of a lower revenue-to-expense ratio.
