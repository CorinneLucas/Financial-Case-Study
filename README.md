# Financial-Case-Study
Financial case study for the fictitious organization Southern Water Corporation. 
# Overview
-Southern Water Corp is a fictitious Israeli water desalination company that sells water to three different customer types: Residential, Public, and Private. 

-As the demand for freshwater is increasing, Southern Water Corp. needs to maximize the availability of its three desalination plants: Kootha, Surjek, and Jutik.

-This increase in demand leads to an increase in revenue, however, it also leads to an increase in production costs.

-This Financial Analysis is made to address both micro and macro analysis questions:

  *"What is the underlying story for the Revenues, Expenses, and EBIT at all plants combined?"

  *"Do the trends in Revenue, Expenses, and EBIT reveal differences between the three plants (Kootha, Surjik, and Jutik)?"

# Revenue
1. MICRO ANALYSIS - The first step in the Revenue Analysis consisted of determining the revenue of each desalination plant, broken down by customer type.
2. MACRO ANALYSIS - Using the revenues from the first step, the next step was to determine the overall revenue for each customer type for the entire company.
3. The last step of this analysis was to determine the contribution percent of each plant's customer segments.

FINDINGS:

-Of the ($437 M) in Revenue Sales over the July 2013 to June 2014 Period, Surjek provides close to 50% of Sales Volumes ($202 M), with Jutik ($164 M) and Kootha ($71 M) providing the remaining.

-Segmentation of the revenues by unit, reveals that of the three (3) customer segments, Private ($187 M) is the most popular, followed by Public ($147 M) and lastly Residential Sales ($102 M).
